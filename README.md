## Project Objective

The main objective of this project is to enable individuals who are concerned about their health to perform an early-stage evaluation and to support their process of consulting healthcare professionals.  
To achieve this, two customized language model configurations and advanced image processing technologies are used together, aiming to help users assess their situation more reliably.

---

## Project Overview

Users visit the web platform and provide a brief description of their health complaint. The system then proceeds through three stages:

1. **General Assessment:**  
   The system interacts conversationally with the user, asking general follow-up questions (e.g., age, lifestyle) to identify the most likely related cancer type.

2. **Detailed Analysis:**  
   The system asks targeted, cancer-specific questions to gather more detailed information, which it analyzes for a deeper evaluation.

3. **Image Processing:**  
   If the user uploads medical images, these images are analyzed using specialized models for various cancer types, and the system provides informative feedback.

---

## Product Features

- **Short Text-Based Initial Assessment:**  
  Users enter a brief description of their health concerns. The system uses natural language processing to analyze the input and then continues by asking general follow-up questions (e.g., age, lifestyle) to gather additional information and suggest the most likely related cancer type.

- **Conversational Cancer-Specific Inquiry:**  
  Following the initial assessment, the system engages users with detailed, relevant questions specific to the identified cancer type, analyzing responses to produce comprehensive evaluations.

- **Medical Image Upload and Analysis:**  
  Users can upload medical images (e.g., MRI, X-ray), which are processed with specialized image analysis models to provide diagnostic feedback.
ied cancer type.  
  The system then provides informative feedback based on the analysis results.

## Target Audience

- Individuals who are concerned about their health
- Users with a family history of cancer
- Adults who wish to perform preliminary screening
- Researchers interested in AI- and image-processing-based health solutions

<details><summary><strong style="font-size:2em">Estimated Completion Points</strong></summary>
<strong>67 points</strong>
</details>

---

<details><summary><strong style="font-size:2em">Estimation Logic</strong></summary>
Sprint task estimation was based on <strong>hour-based workload</strong> estimates using the following methodology:

| **Estimated Time** | **Story Points** |
|:------------------:|:----------------:|
| 1 day (8 hours) | 4 |
| Half day (4 hours) | 2 |
| 2 hours | 1 |
| 1 hour and below | 0.5 |

Due to team members' various responsibilities such as internships and work commitments, weekday working hours were expected to be more limited while weekends would be more intensive. Therefore, task time estimates and point allocation were planned considering this balance:

- **Weekdays:** Typically 1-2 hour work blocks were planned
- **Weekends:** Longer focused work sessions (4-5 hours) were targeted

Consequently, task time estimates and point allocation were prepared considering this balance, and the sprint target was set at **67 points** total.

<details><summary><strong style="font-size:2em">Daily Scrum</strong></summary>

Initially, WhatsApp was used for Daily Scrum notifications and tracking. However, to ensure a more organized and manageable process, we transitioned to using Google Forms. The final form (shown below) was created, and reminder messages were sent via WhatsApp to each team member to complete the form daily.

Responses submitted through the form are automatically collected and stored in a Google Sheet, providing a centralized and easily accessible record. This approach has made daily progress tracking more transparent and systematic.

---

<details><summary><strong style="font-size:2em">Sprint Notes</strong></summary>

#### Completed
- The implementation of new pages were successfully completed. The assigned team member also took the initiative to design and develop additional pages such as FAQ and History, which were listed in the side navigation but not initially planned within the sprint scope.
- The project structure was reorganized into a more modular form. Since the frontend implementation of the login process was necessary for backend testing, corresponding login functionalities were also developed and integrated into the backend. Additionally, critical endpoints for connecting with the Large Language Model (LLM) were implemented.
- Machine learning models targeting various types of cancer were successfully developed. During this sprint, image classification models were trained to detect colon, lung, and leukemia cancers.
Furthermore, data transformation and prediction methods were implemented in Python to support the deployment of these models. As a result, the foundational logic required for integrating the models with backend services has been established.

---

#### Challenges Encountered
- Although frontend testing has started, progress has been slower than expected.
- The LLM integration, which is essential for enabling detailed analysis, has not yet been completed.
- While initial efforts to connect ML models with backend services have begun, full integration and testing for even a single model have not yet been achieved.

<details><summary><strong style="font-size:2em">Sprint Review</strong></summary>
The planned work for this sprint was largely completed, with notable progress and initiative shown across multiple areas:

- While only core pages were initially scoped, additional pages like FAQ and History were also designed and implemented, enhancing UI consistency and completeness.
- Backend architecture was refactored into a modular structure.
- LLM-related endpoints were created, allowing the system to begin communication with the language model.  
- Machine learning models for five different cancer types â€” Colon, Lung, Leukemia (Blood Cancer), Brain Tumor, and Skin Cancer â€” were successfully trained and tested. Supporting Python methods for prediction and data transformation were also developed to facilitate backend integration.
- The team continued to improve coordination and cross-functional collaboration, aligning efforts across frontend, backend, and ML tasks to increase efficiency.

</details>

---

<details><summary><strong style="font-size:2em">Sprint Retrospective</strong></summary>

### What Went Well
- The training and evaluation of ML models progressed exceptionally well. In just a short two-week sprint, datasets for **five different cancer types** (Colon, Lung, Leukemia, Brain Tumor, and Skin Cancer) were collected, preprocessed, and used to successfully train image classification models. Overfitting issues were resolved during training, and corresponding data transformation and prediction methods were implemented in Python, laying a solid foundation for integration.
- Although not originally planned for this sprint, FAQ and Report pages were both designed and implemented on the frontend, showing strong initiative and ownership from the responsible team member.
- Initial integration steps were taken with the LLM, including the implementation of basic communication and session-handling logic on the backend. While limited in scope, this progress marked an important step toward system-wide functionality.

---

### What Went Badly
- The LLM prompt for the Detailed Analysis module was expected to be finalized in this sprint but was delayed due to the availability constraints of the assigned team member.
- UI testing remains insufficient; despite some manual tests, automated test coverage is still lacking and needs to be prioritized.
- Integration efforts â€” especially between ML models and the backend â€” progressed slower than necessary. Not a single full end-to-end connection (ML â†’ Backend â†’ Frontend) was completed during this sprint.

---

### Areas for Improvement
- Integration efforts should be initiated earlier in the sprint cycle, particularly when multiple teams or components (e.g., ML, backend, frontend) are involved. Delaying these steps creates avoidable dependencies near sprint-end.
- Task planning must better reflect realistic availability of contributors, especially for components requiring specialized domain knowledge (e.g., LLM).
- More frequent cross-functional checkpoints should be scheduled to ensure blockers in one part of the stack are surfaced early and resolved quickly.
- Tasks were distributed without actively monitoring emerging bottlenecks during the sprint. There should be a mechanism to reassign available team members to support areas that are falling behind, especially for integration-critical tasks.

---

### Next Sprint Tasks
- Finalize and validate the LLM prompt for Detailed Analysis, enabling advanced text-based interpretations for the supported cancer types.
- Begin full MLâ€“Backend integration, starting with one cancer model and expanding gradually. Create endpoints that allow the frontend to request predictions.
- Implement the Frontendâ€“Backend connection for prediction features, especially for pages like Report that will display model results.

#### Completed
- The second LLM prompt was finalized and its structure completed.
- A chat interface was added to the project. The integration of the second LLM prompt and related models was completed to support the chat functionality.
- To avoid increasing the project size, models were uploaded to Google Drive and configured to be dynamically downloaded based on the chat flow.
- The integration structure for the first LLM prompt was also updated, and all LLM-related integrations were finalized in this sprint.
- Backend support for the support pop-up was implemented. User complaints and requests are now sent to a designated email address via Formspree.
- The My Reports page was updated and finalized:
  - Users can resume incomplete conversations from this page.
  - They can view their full conversation history.
  - Completed conversations now display a risk status: High / Medium / Low.
  - The user's overall risk profile is visually presented using a donut chart on the right side of the page.
  - A new assessment can be initiated using the "Start New Assessment" button.
- A new project logo was added and visual updates were made.
- LLM prompts were refined and comparative testing was conducted across Gemini models.
- A FastAPI-based REST API was developed for colon, lung, and leukemia cancer types.
- Frontend and backend integration was successfully completed.
- The user interface was manually tested, and test scenarios were documented in a dedicated testing document. 

---

#### Challenges Encountered
- The most significant challenge was the inconsistent behavior of the second LLM prompt. In some cases, the suspectedCancerType field was not properly identified within the chat flow, preventing the system from progressing to the final stepâ€”where the model analyzes the uploaded image and determines whether the cancer is benign or malignant. Additionally, the LLM sometimes failed to provide sufficiently coherent or meaningful responses.
- Another challenge involved internal disagreements about the core product flow: whether the assessment should be conducted across multiple separate pages or within a single chat-based interface.

---

#### Solutions
- Multiple variations of the second LLM prompt were tested, and the most effective version was selected and integrated into the project.
- To resolve disagreements on the product structure, a small market and user behavior research study was conducted. Findings were shared with the Product Owner, and a chat-based user experience was chosen as the main interaction model for the assessment flow.

---

#### Lessons Learned
- The prompt engineering process requires more trial and error than initially expected. Building flexible prompt strategies early on is essential.
- Looking at existing solutions and real user behavior can help resolve internal conflicts about product design and improve decision-making.
- Projects that involve both frontend and AI systems benefit greatly from simplified and well-defined workflows, which reduce the likelihood of integration issues down the line.

<details><summary><strong style="font-size:2em">Estimated Completion Points</strong></summary>
<strong> 48 points</strong>
</details>

---

<details><summary><strong style="font-size:2em">Estimation Logic</strong></summary>
Sprint task estimation was based on <strong>hour-based workload</strong> estimates using the following methodology:

| **Estimated Time** | **Story Points** |
|:------------------:|:----------------:|
| 1 day (8 hours) | 4 |
| Half day (4 hours) | 2 |
| 2 hours | 1 |
| 1 hour and below | 0.5 |

Due to team members' various responsibilities such as internships and work commitments, weekday working hours were expected to be more limited while weekends would be more intensive. Therefore, task time estimates and point allocation were planned considering this balance:

- **Weekdays:** Typically 1-2 hour work blocks were planned
- **Weekends:** Longer focused work sessions (4-5 hours) were targeted

Consequently, task time estimates and point allocation were prepared considering this balance, and the sprint target was set at **48 points** total.

<details><summary><strong style="font-size:2em">Daily Scrum</strong></summary>

The daily scrum process continued to be conducted via Google Form in this sprint, as it proved to be time-efficient and effective. This method allowed team members to fill out the form at a convenient time during the day, without being restricted to a fixed meeting slot.

If any blockers were mentioned, the Scrum Master reviewed them and followed up directly with the relevant team member to resolve the issue. As in previous sprints, daily reminders were sent via WhatsApp to ensure consistent participation.

### What Went Well

- The integration between frontend and backend was completed faster and more smoothly than expected. This integration made the overall system operation clearer and more stable.
- During this sprint, team members became more active in meetings, clearly expressing their concerns and questions. This led to faster and more inclusive solutions for issues and system design.
- The redesigned My Reports page significantly improved user experience by offering a centralized location for viewing full conversation history, risk statuses, and launching new assessments.
- The chat interface was successfully implemented and connected to the second LLM prompt. The integration allowed for smooth dialogue-based assessments, further enhancing user interactivity.

### What Went Badly

- The behavior of the LLM prompts was not tested extensively enough. More comprehensive testing across diverse scenarios and varied user profiles was needed to ensure consistent and reliable responses.
- The project structure and overall technical workflows were not fully understood by the team. As a result, limited personnel were involved in backend and frontend tasks during this sprint. However, since model training was completed at the end of sprint 2, resource allocation could have been planned more effectively. An informative session to help everyone understand the project end-to-end would have been beneficial.

### Areas for Improvement

- The product scope and task distribution should be clearly defined before the sprint begins, ensuring tasks are allocated to encourage full team participation rather than being limited by individual technical skills.
- Thorough testing processes need to be enhanced, with more comprehensive test cases covering a variety of user scenarios and profiles, especially for LLM prompts and model behavior.
- Onboarding sessions should be organized to familiarize all team members with the system architecture, file structure, setup procedures, and where to add or modify code. This would help especially those with reduced workload after the model training phase ended in the previous sprint.
- To boost motivation, small team-building activities, feedback meetings, and celebrations of milestones should be implemented.

### Future Considerations

(Since a bootcamp event is planned and there is no next sprint, this section contains general improvement suggestions.)

- More machine learning models targeting different types of cancer should be added to the system.
- Tests involving a wider variety of user profiles and scenarios should be conducted on the LLM side.
- The ability of LLM prompts to handle different types of outputs should be thoroughly examined.
- Load testing should be performed to measure system performance when multiple users access it simultaneously.
